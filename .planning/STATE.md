## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Replace contentlayer2 (Broken, incompatible with Turbopack, hangs at 100% CPU)
- Separate locale files (Cleaner than markers, easier to maintain)
- File-based over CMS (Simpler deployment, git-versioned, fits scale)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 2 (Velite Implementation):**
- Verify complex rehype plugin options (rehypeAutolinkHeadings with behavior callbacks) work with Turbopack string references

**Phase 3 (Bilingual Integration):**
- Hebrew typography specifics need testing (font sizing, line-height, bold/italic alternatives)

**Phase 5 (Discovery Features):**
- Hebrew search library verification needed (Pagefind RTL support quality for Hebrew stemming)
