========================================
--- Iteration 2 --- Sun Jan 11 09:08:26 IST 2026
========================================
**CRAWL-02 completed.** The dynamic sitemap was already properly implemented at `/app/sitemap.ts` with:
- Next.js `MetadataRoute.Sitemap` export
- All static pages (home, about, blog) for both locales
- All published blog posts from Contentlayer
- Proper hreflang alternates on every URL
- Correct lastModified dates

The task is now marked as `pass: true` in PRD.json and progress has been logged. Not all tasks are complete yet, so the loop continues.
