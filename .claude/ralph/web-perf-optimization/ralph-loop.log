--- Iteration 1 --- Sat Jan 10 20:05:51 IST 2026
========================================
**CRP-01 Complete.**

**Summary:**
- Audited current bundle composition
- Found 676KB gzipped total (target is <300KB)
- THREE.js accounts for 412KB gzipped (61% of bundle) in two 732KB chunks
- Both chunks contain THREE.js core, EffectComposer, RenderPass, UnrealBloomPass, GSAP, and ScrollTrigger
- Key issue: THREE.js is directly imported without code splitting
- Updated progress.txt with detailed findings
- Updated PRD.json to mark CRP-01 as `pass: true`
- Committed changes

**Next task:** CRP-02 - Font optimization (depends on CRP-01 which is now complete)
